UNIX Knowledge Assessment #0
============================
Overview
========
You have the entirety of class today to solve this task- this activity is
OPEN RESOURCE with the exception of other people. In that regard, it is
CLOSED PERSON. You are to do this on your own.

If you are reading this, you have successfully accessed and extracted the
files from the archive. In addition to this file, you should also have
the following additional new files:

	data.file - information you have to unscramble
	dec2asc.c - a C program that converts space-separated decimal values
	            to their corresponding ASCII representation
	
	hex2asc.c - a C program that converts space-separated hexadecimal
				values (in byte-sized chunks) to their corresponding
				ASCII representation

Instructions
============
Using your skills, unravel 'data.file' until you encounter a message that
"YOU ARE DONE SUBMIT NOW!!" (note that it may not be in this exact type
of orientation, but will be readable along with recognizable information)

When you reach the submit state, before submitting, you MUST do the
following in order to get full credit:

	1. Put the fully readable/recognizable end result of data.file into
	   a new file called 'results'
	
	2. At the end of the file, put the exact sequence of commands you 
	   used from the point of copying the archive through all this step:
	   I should be able to run each command end end up with your exact
	   same end result.
	
	3. Submit this 'results' file using the submit tool:

			submit unix unixka0 results

Now you really are done!
