Puzzlebox Deux
==============
You got this far- good!

Now the real fun begins. There is a file in the archive
called 'big_endian.ascii'; its password is "1337" (without the quotes).
Decrypt and extract it from the archive.

Look inside: big_endian.ascii

Figure out the encoding and 'decode' it.

Put it in a file called: stage2

Run this command:

cat stage2 | cut -d':' -f2 > $(cat stage2 | cut -d':' -f1).ascii

List your files. Anything new? That's where you want to direct your
attention next. Another (similar) code, just expressed differently.

Go and decode it, putting the result in a file called: password

The password to unlock the other files is stored in this file! Note
any and all spaces!

You should now be able to decrypt the remainder of the archive; there
are 4 files you are after: part1, part2, part3, and part4.

You need to combine parts 1, 2, and 3 into one file (called together.txt),
and arrange the lines in sequential order. Save the final combined/sorted
file as a file called 'result.txt'.

The contents of the file 'part4' are then to be appended to the end of
your 'result.txt' file.

That's it! Go ahead and submit it! You've solved this Puzzlebox!

The command to submit this project is:

submit unix puzzlebox2 results.txt
