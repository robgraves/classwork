to copy to HOME itself I could have done:

cp /var/public/UNIX/projects/dataproc/info.c ~

or 

cp /var/public/UNIX/projects/dataproc/info.c /home/mp010784/

but what i actually did was move it into the approprate subdirectory I had created for it in my home
folder with:

cp /var/public/UNIX/projects/dataproc/info.c ~/src/unix/projects/dataproc/
